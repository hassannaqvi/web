                <p>Julian has completely transformed my health journey through the Amani Framework, which beautifully blends fitness, faith, and overall well-being. He helped me heal my lower back, lose weight, and grow mentally and spiritually in ways I never expected. Embracing his holistic approach has been one of the most empowering decisions I’ve ever made</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Before working with Julian through Amani Coaching, I was morbidly obese, discouraged, disciplined in the wrong direction, without a sound strategy to turn my situation around and tackle the mounting issues I am facing due to decades of an unhealthy lifestyle. Through his prophetic insight, practical strategies, and faith-filled guidance, I’ve experienced hope that I will not always be burdened with sickness or weighed down by unhelpful and unhealthy choices. I now feel hopeful that though it will take time and effort I can make a change that will extend and enhance my life for good. I’d recommend Amani to any leader seeking to grow in wellness, purpose, and alignment with God.</p>

                <p>Before Amani Coaching with Julian, I felt stuck professionally and personally. Within six weeks, I've experienced significant life improvement thanks to his effective, science-backed biblical insights and tailored weekly calls that consistently hit the mark. Goals once insurmountable are now progressing. Amani Coaching is truly transformational, and I highly recommend it to any leader seeking growth in wellness, purpose, and alignment with God.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>When I started working with Julian, I did not know what to expect. Although I was specifically interested in financial coaching, it was evident pretty quickly that I needed to tease apart other areas of my life that were deeply intertwined with my financial practices. Through the Amani framework, I was able to get to the root of some of the patterns that I wanted to break down. As someone who has always been considered at best an overachiever and at worst a workaholic, through the coaching process, I was able to integrate a more balanced, faith-first approach to my work that has allowed me to work more efficiently, while making much needed time for feeding my spiritual needs.</p>
